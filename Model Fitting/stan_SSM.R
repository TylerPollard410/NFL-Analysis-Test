## --- 3.2: Traceplots and marginal distributions (bayesplot) ----

# Example: plot traces for a few key parameters (last fit)
draws_array <- fit$draws(format = "draws_array")

# Example for sigma, tau_week, tau_season, hfa_league

bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws_array, pars = c("strength[1,1]", "strength[1,10]", "strength[1,20]"))

## --- 3.3: Posterior Predictive Checks ----

# You saved y_rep in Stan (generated quantities)
# Extract from the last fit, plot predictive checks
y_rep <- fit$draws("y_rep") |> posterior::as_draws_matrix()
y_rep <- as.matrix(y_rep)

# For actual OOS games: (if you want PPC for all training games, use train_data$result)
# Let's use the last week's forecasted games:
y_actual <- train_data$result

# PPC: overlay posterior predictive for these games
samps <- samp
bayesplot::ppc_dens_overlay(y_actual, y_rep[, 1:ncol(as.matrix(y_rep))]) # adjust columns to match y_actual length

## --- 3.4: Summarize Posterior for Key Parameters (posterior, tidybayes) ----

# Posterior mean, sd, intervals for core parameters
fit$summary(variables = c("sigma", "tau_week", "tau_season", "rho_week", "rho_season", "hfa_league"))

# Example: posterior draws for first 3 teams' strength, last week

  theme_minimal()

## --- 3.5: Performance metrics for all 2024 OOS games ----

# Already calculated in prior code, but here's a summary again:
all_forecasts_2024 |>
  summarize(
    MAE = Metrics::mae(result, pred_mu),
    RMSE = Metrics::rmse(result, pred_mu),

    Coverage95 = mean(result >= pred_lower_95 & result <= pred_upper_95, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) |> print()

## --- 3.6: Interactive exploration (optional) ----
# Use bayesplot's MCMC interactive for trace and pair plots:
# mcmc_intervals(draws_array, pars = c("sigma", "tau_week", "tau_season", "hfa_league"))
# mcmc_pairs(draws_array, pars = c("sigma", "tau_week", "tau_season"))

## --- 3.7: Save outputs for later analysis ----
# saveRDS(fit, "stan_fit_last_week.rds")
# saveRDS(all_forecasts_2024, "all_forecasts_2024.rds")
